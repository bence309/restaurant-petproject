Project Title: Pizza Restaurant üçï

Welcome to my Pizza Restaurant, a delightful pizza-ordering site developed as a pet project during my Codecool bootcamp journey. This web application is built using a stack that includes React, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and a sprinkle of HTML and CSS for that extra flavor.

Exciting Menu Page: Explore the Menu page, where users are presented with a random pizza, dessert, and drink, all with a tempting 20% discount for an extra flavor burst.

Light-Mode/Dark-Mode Toggle: This Pizza Restaurant offers a customizable visual experience with a toggle between light and dark modes.

Behind the Scenes:

JSON-server for Food Data: This app uses a JSON-server to manage and serve the delectable food items available for ordering.

Express.js & MongoDB Integration: The "real" Express server is primarily employed to communicate with MongoDB, where user information is stored after registration.
